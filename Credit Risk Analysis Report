Overview:
The purpose of this analysis is to assess the performance of different machine learning models for credit risk analysis.
The goal is to determine the most suitable model for predicting high-risk loans and healthy loans, aiding in the decision-making process for loan approvals.

Results:
 - Accuracy Score: The selected machine learning model achieved an impressive accuracy of 99%, indicating its ability to correctly classify loans.
 - Precision Score (High-Risk Loans): The precision for high-risk loans is 0.87, highlighting that around 87% of loans predicted as high-risk are indeed high-risk.
 - Recall Score (High-Risk Loans): The recall for high-risk loans is 0.89, indicating the model's capability to identify approximately 89% of actual high-risk loans.

Summary:
The machine learning model employed in this credit risk analysis demonstrates strong predictive capabilities.
It achieves a remarkable accuracy of 99%, suggesting robust performance in classifying loans.
The model excels in identifying healthy loans, as indicated by its high precision and recall scores for class '0'.
While the precision and recall scores for high-risk loans (class 1) are slightly lower, the model still exhibits a balanced performance, as reflected in its F1-score of 0.88 for class '1'.
These metrics collectively indicate the model's ability to effectively capture both high-risk and healthy loans.

Recommendations:
Based on the analysis, the recommended machine learning model is well-suited for the company's credit risk analysis needs.
Its high accuracy, strong precision and recall scores, and balanced F1-score make it a reliable tool for identifying loans that are likely to be high-risk.
The model's balanced performance suggests that it can minimize false positives and false negatives to a reasonable extent.
Given its ability to accurately classify loans and its potential to enhance the loan approval process, the recommended model holds significant promise for improving credit risk assessment.
